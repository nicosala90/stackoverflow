# Stackoverflow TW Project

## Purpose
Implement a 'StackOverflow' kind APP in teamwork using JAVA SpirngBoot and connect to PostgreSQL database. By 'StackOverflow" we mean that in the applications the users can write questions, and other users can write answers to questions.

## Technologies
- JAVA SpirngBoot
- PostgreSQL
- TymeLeaf
- Vanilla Javascript

## Tasks:
- implement user administration page
- implement question administration features (e.g. add, delete, list)
- implement answer giving feature and count the number of answers and show these results

## General requirements: 
- Create an SQL database to store your data
- Stick to Model View Controller layers (Frontend doesn't do calculations, only displays the data, SQL handles the data manipulation)
- Do the base data features first and add user management later, extend already existing ones if necessary 
- Aim for the code to keep SOLID, OOP, and Clean code principles
