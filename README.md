# Stackoverflow TW Project

## Purpose
Implement a 'Stackoverlow' kind APP in teamwork with PostgreSQL database, Java backend and Java frontend (we got special help for this).

## Tasks:
- implement user administration page
- implement question administration features (e.g. add, delete, list)
- implement answer giving feature and count the numbers of answers and show these results

## General requirements: 
- Create an SQL database to store your data
- Stick to Model View Controller layers (Frontend doesn't do calculations, only displays the data, SQL handles the data manipulation)
- Do the base data features first and add user management later, extend already existing ones if necessary 
- Aim for the code to keep SOLID, OOP and Clean code principles
